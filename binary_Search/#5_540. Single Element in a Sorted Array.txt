You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

Return the single element that appears only once.

Your solution must run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
0 <= nums[i] <= 105

Solution(#1) -> Binary Search -> O(logn)

Intution:
The pairs which are on the left of the single element, will have the first element in an even position and the second element at an odd position.
All the pairs which are on the right side of the single element will have the first position at an odd position and the second element at an even position.
Use this fact to decide whether to go to the left side of the array or the right side.

class Solution {
public:
    int singleNonDuplicate(vector<int>& arr) {
        int l = 0, r = arr.size()-1;

        while(l<=r){
            int mid = l +(r-l)/2;

            if(mid % 2 == 0){
                if(mid+1 < r+1 && arr[mid] == arr[mid+1]){
                    l = mid+1;  
                }
                else if(mid-1 >= 0 && arr[mid] == arr[mid-1]){
                    r = mid-1;   
                }
                else{
                    return arr[mid];
                }
            }
            else{

                if(mid+1 < r+1 && arr[mid] == arr[mid+1]){
                    r = mid-1; 
                }
                else if(mid-1 >= 0 && arr[mid] == arr[mid-1]){
                    l = mid+1;  
                }
                else{
                    return arr[mid];
                }
            }

            
        }

        return 0;
        
    }
};


Solution(#2) => slightly more optimal binary search

Intution:
If the mid element is the local maximum. Cool! Return.

But if it isn't, and no two adjacent elements are equal, then either of the elements (or maybe both of them) will be greater than our mid element.

Now whichever side has the greater element, we can go to that side and continue the same process.


class Solution {
public:
    int singleNonDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        int l = 0, r = nums.size() - 1;

        while (l < r) {
            int mid = l + (r - l) / 2;

            // ensure mid is even
            if (mid % 2 == 1) mid--;

            if (nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]) {
                l = mid + 2;   // skip the pair
            } else {
                r = mid;       // single is on left (or mid)
            }
        }
        return nums[l];
    }
};
