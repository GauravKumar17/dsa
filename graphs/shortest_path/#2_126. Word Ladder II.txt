A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
sk == endWord
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return all the shortest transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words [beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk].

 

Example 1:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: [["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]
Explanation: There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
"hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"
"hit" -> "hot" -> "lot" -> "log" -> "cog"
Example 2:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: []
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
 

Constraints:

1 <= beginWord.length <= 5
endWord.length == beginWord.length
1 <= wordList.length <= 500
wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
beginWord != endWord
All the words in wordList are unique.
The sum of all shortest transformation sequences does not exceed 105.


Solution(#1) => BFS (MLE)

Core Idea:

Use BFS to explore transformations level by level.

Store full paths in the queue.

When endWord is found, collect only shortest length paths.

🔹 Key Steps

1️⃣ Convert wordList into unordered_set for O(1) lookup.

2️⃣ Use: queue<vector<string>> q;
        Each queue element stores a full transformation path.

3️⃣ Level-wise processing:

Track current level.

Remove visited words after finishing a level.

Ensures shortest paths only.

4️⃣ For each word:

Try replacing each character with 'a' → 'z'.

If new word exists in set:

Push new path into queue.

Mark visited.

5️⃣ If word == endWord:

Add path to result.

Only keep paths of same shortest size.

🔹 Why Level-Based Removal?

To allow:

Same level words to reuse nodes

Prevent revisiting in deeper levels

                        vec.pop_back();
