You are given an array of digits called digits. Your task is to determine the number of distinct three-digit even numbers that can be formed using these digits.

Note: Each copy of a digit can only be used once per number, and there may not be leading zeros.

 

Example 1:

Input: digits = [1,2,3,4]

Output: 12

Explanation: The 12 distinct 3-digit even numbers that can be formed are 124, 132, 134, 142, 214, 234, 312, 314, 324, 342, 412, and 432. Note that 222 cannot be formed because there is only 1 copy of the digit 2.

Example 2:

Input: digits = [0,2,2]

Output: 2

Explanation: The only 3-digit even numbers that can be formed are 202 and 220. Note that the digit 2 can be used twice because it appears twice in the array.








Intuition
Solve using nested loops and an unorderd_set
We use unordered_set because:

-digits may repeat
-recursion generates permutations using indexes, not unique values
-same number can appear multiple times
-set ensures distinct numbers

Approach
use 3 loops

-->first loop should look that 0 should not be present in the hundredth place
-->second loops checks that the index which first loop is using should not be used by me (i.e, i should be not equal to j)
--> Third loops look that the the index used by first(i) and second(j) should not use be used by me.
It also ensures that the last place is even

after all this inside the third loop we takr the value of i,j,k and generate a 3 digit even number and store it inside an unordered set.

and finally coming out of all the loop we return the size of the unordered set to find the number of valid 3 digits even strings we generated.

Complexity
Time complexity: O(n3)
Space complexity: O(n)

class Solution {
public:
    int totalNumbers(vector<int>& digits) {
        unordered_set<int>res;
        int len = digits.size();
        

        for(int i=0;i<len;i++){
            if(digits[i]==0){
                continue;
            }
            for(int j=0;j<len;j++){
                if(i==j){
                    continue;
                }
                for(int k=0;k<len;k++){
                    if(k==j || k==i){
                        continue;
                    }
                    if(digits[k]%2 != 0){
                        continue;
                    }
                    int num = 100*digits[i]+10*digits[j]+digits[k];
                    res.insert(num);
                }
            }
        }
        return res.size();
