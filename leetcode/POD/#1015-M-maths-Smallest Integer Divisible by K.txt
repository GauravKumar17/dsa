1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K

Given a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n such that n is divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1.

Return the length of n. If there is no such n, return -1.

Note: n may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 1, which has length 1.
Example 2:

Input: k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2.
Example 3:

Input: k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.

Constraints:

1 <= k <= 10^5


solution
//curr = ((curr*10)+1) =>0*10+1=1, 1*10+1=11, 11*10+1=11........

now when we divide curr = ((curr*10)+1)%5 it stores only remainder (storing rem have no affect on divisibility by k;  if some curr is divisible by k => when storing it rem will act as it is divisible by k(more explaination in blue copy after recursion) )


#Optimal approach

class Solution {
public:
    int smallestRepunitDivByK(int k) {
        string num = "1";
        int curr = 0;
        if(k%2==0 || k%5==0){
            return -1;
        }
        while(true){
        curr = ((curr*10)+1)%k;   
        
        if( curr==0){
            return num.length();
        }
        else{
            num.append("1");
        }
    }

        return -1;
        
    }
};

// Brute force approach (memomry overflow after test case 25/70 , k=23  since k=10^5 )

class Solution {
public:
    int smallestRepunitDivByK(int k) {
        string num = "1";
        if(k%2==0 || k%5==0){
            return -1;
        }
        while(true){
        long long int n = stoll(num);
        if( n%k==0){
            return num.length();
        }
        else{
            num.append("1");
        }
    }

        return -1;
        
    }
};
