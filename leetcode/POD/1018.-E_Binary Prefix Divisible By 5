1018. Binary Prefix Divisible By 5

ou are given a binary array nums (0-indexed).

We define xi as the number whose binary representation is the subarray nums[0..i] (from most-significant-bit to least-significant-bit).

For example, if nums = [1,0,1], then x0 = 1, x1 = 2, and x2 = 5.
Return an array of booleans answer where answer[i] is true if xi is divisible by 5.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: [true,false,false]
Explanation: The input numbers in binary are 0, 01, 011; which are 0, 1, and 3 in base-10.
Only the first number is divisible by 5, so answer[0] is true.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: [false,false,false]

solution

brute-force (python)

***note- this approach gives overflow error in c++ because of memory oveflow(cannot handle 10^5 array length)
this doesnt happen in python because pyhton has arbitrray large integers

class Solution:
    def prefixesDivBy5(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[bool]:
        
        v1 = []
        v = ""

        for x in nums:
            v += str(x)           //stoi or stoll i c++         
            if int(v, 2) % 5 == 0:          # convert binary to int
                v1.append(True)
            else:
                v1.append(False)

        return v1




optimal approach through bit manipulation

class Solution {
public:
    vector<bool> prefixesDivBy5(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<bool>v1;
        int curr = 0;
        for(int x: nums){
            curr = ((curr << 1) + x)%5; //storing the remainder after  dividing by 5
            v1.push_back(curr % 5 == 0 );
        }

        return v1;
    }
};
