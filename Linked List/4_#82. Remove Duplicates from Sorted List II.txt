Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers,
 leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.


Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
Output: [1,2,5]
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

Solution(#1)=> t.c => O(n),s.c = O(1)

        }

        ListNode*curr = head;
        ListNode*prev = NULL;

        while(curr){
            if(curr->next!=NULL && curr->val == curr->next->val){
                while(curr->next!=NULL && curr->val == curr->next->val){
                    curr=curr->next;

                curr = curr->next;
                if(prev == NULL){
