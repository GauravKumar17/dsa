You are organizing the International Kite Festival in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. Participants record their kite string lengths on measurement cards. Each card contains a sequence of single-digit numbers (0–9) written in reverse order (from centimeters to meters). These numbers represent string lengths for different kite categories.

During the competition's grand finale, organizers must combine string lengths from two kites to create a special tandem flying category.

However, there is a measurement rule:

Each digit in the resulting length must be multiplied by a calibration factor k (to account for wind resistance).

Only the last digit of each multiplication is kept (i.e., modulo 10 operation).

📌 The measurement cards are represented as linked lists where each node contains a single digit.

You must:

Add the two lengths represented by the linked lists.

Apply the calibration factor k to each digit of the sum.

Keep only the last digit of each multiplication (digit * k % 10).

Return the result as a new linked list in reverse order.

⚠️ Important Notes

Carry operations happen before applying the calibration factor.

After multiplying by k, do not apply carry again.

If sum of two lengths is 807 and k = 2:

8 × 2 = 16 → keep 6

0 × 2 = 0

7 × 2 = 14 → keep 4

Result becomes: [6, 0, 4]

📘 Example 1
Input:
l1 = [2, 4, 3]
l2 = [5, 6, 4]
k = 2

Explanation:

Numbers represented:

l1 = 342
l2 = 465


Addition:

342 + 465 = 807


Reverse form:

[7, 0, 8]


Apply calibration factor:

7 × 2 = 14 → 4
0 × 2 = 0
8 × 2 = 16 → 6

Output:
[4, 0, 6]


Solution(#1)


ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2, int k) {
    ListNode* temp = l1;
    ListNode* temp2 = l2;

    ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(-1);
    ListNode* temp3 = dummy;
    int carry = 0;
    while(temp || temp2 || carry){
         int sum = carry;
         if(temp){
            sum += temp->val;
            temp = temp->next;
         }
         if(temp2){
            sum += temp2->val;
            temp2 = temp2->next;
         }
            carry = sum/10;;
            sum = sum%10;
         
         int value = (sum *k )%10;
        dummy ->next = new ListNode(value);
        dummy = dummy->next;
    
    }
    return temp3->next;

}
