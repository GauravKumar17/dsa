You are given an array of integers arr.

Your task is to construct a 2D array such that:

The first element of each row is a distinct integer value from the array.

The second element of each row is the frequency of that integer in the array.

After constructing this 2D array, sort it using the following rules:

Sort by frequency in descending order.

If two integers have the same frequency, sort them by their value in ascending order.

Return the sorted 2D array.

🔹 Example
Input:
arr = [3, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2]

Explanation:

1 appears 1 time

2 appears 3 times

3 appears 2 times

Output:
[
  [2, 3],
  [3, 2],
  [1, 1]
]

🔹 Constraints (Typical)

1 ≤ arr.length ≤ 10^5

-10^9 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9


Solution(#1)

vector<vector<int>> groupSort(vector<int> arr) {
    vector<vector<int>>ans;
    map<int ,int>mp;
    for(int x:arr){
        mp[x]++;
    }
    
    for(auto &p: mp){
        ans.push_back({p.first,p.second});
    }
    
    sort(ans.begin(),ans.end(),[](auto &a, auto &b){
        if(a[1] == b[1]){
            return a[0] < b[0];
        }
        else{
            return a[1] > b[1];
        }
    });
    
    return ans;
}
