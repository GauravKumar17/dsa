Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
Example 2:

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists only of lowercase English letters.


Solution(#1)=> bottom up approach (t.c=>O(n*n))

Intution=> similar to lcs problem, just send string2 as reverse of string1 => ans will laways be a longest palindromic subsequence

class Solution {
public:
    int longestPalindromeSubseq(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<vector<int>>dp(n+1,vector<int>(n+1,0));
        string str = s;
        reverse(s.begin(),s.end());

        for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--){
            for(int j=n-1;j>=0;j--){
                if(s[i] == str[j]){
                    dp[i][j] = 1+dp[i+1][j+1];
                }
                else{
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j],dp[i][j+1]);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[0][0];

        
    }
};
