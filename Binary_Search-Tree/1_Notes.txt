Binary Search Tree->
    1. A tree in which the elements in the left is smaller than the node and the element in the right is greater than the node.
        i.e For every Subtree :- left<Node<Right
    2.Height of the binary tree is always log n.
    3.searching/inserting/deleting in a complete binary search tree  takes O(log n) time.4
    (Only balanced BSTs guarantee O(log n))


    Ex:
        8
       / \
      3   10
     / \    \
    1   6    14
       / \   /
      4   7 13
