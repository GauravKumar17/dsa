You are given a 0-indexed integer array arr, and an m x n integer matrix mat. arr and mat both contain all the integers in the range [1, m * n].

Go through each index i in arr starting from index 0 and paint the cell in mat containing the integer arr[i].

Return the smallest index i at which either a row or a column will be completely painted in mat.

 

Example 1:

image explanation for example 1
Input: arr = [1,3,4,2], mat = [[1,4],[2,3]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The moves are shown in order, and both the first row and second column of the matrix become fully painted at arr[2].
Example 2:

image explanation for example 2
Input: arr = [2,8,7,4,1,3,5,6,9], mat = [[3,2,5],[1,4,6],[8,7,9]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The second column becomes fully painted at arr[3].
 

Constraints:

m == mat.length
n = mat[i].length
arr.length == m * n
1 <= m, n <= 105
1 <= m * n <= 105
1 <= arr[i], mat[r][c] <= m * n
All the integers of arr are unique.
All the integers of mat are unique.


Solution(#1)=> T.c(O(M∗N+Arr.Length))

Approach
1️⃣ Mapping Cell Values to Indices
Traverse the matrix mat and store the position of each number as (row, column) in a hash map.
Reason: This allows O(1) lookup for any number in arr.
2️⃣ Tracking Uncolored Cells
Initialize two arrays:
rowCount: An array of size m (number of rows), where each entry starts with n (number of columns).
colCount: An array of size n (number of columns), where each entry starts with m (number of rows).
These arrays track the remaining uncolored cells for each row and column.
3️⃣ Processing the Painting Sequence
Iterate through arr:
For each number:
Use the hash map to get its position (row, column) in the matrix.
Decrement the uncolored counts in rowCount and colCount.
Check if either count becomes zero:
If yes, return the current index as the result.
4️⃣ Returning the Result
The logic ensures that a row or column will eventually be fully painted. If no row or column is found (unlikely with valid input), return -1.

    int firstCompleteIndex(vector<int>& arr, vector<vector<int>>& mat) {

        int col = mat[0].size();
        vector<int>rowCount(row,col);
        vector<int>colCount(col,row);

        for(int i=0;i<row;i++){

                mp[mat[i][j]] = {i,j};
            }
        }

        for(int i=0;i<arr.size();i++){
            int val = arr[i];
            
            auto [row,col] = mp[val];

            rowCount[row]--;
            colCount[col]--;

            if(rowCount[row]==0 || colCount[col]==0){
                return i;
            }

        }
        return 0;
