You are given the customer visit log of a shop represented by a 0-indexed string customers consisting only of characters 'N' and 'Y':

if the ith character is 'Y', it means that customers come at the ith hour
whereas 'N' indicates that no customers come at the ith hour.
If the shop closes at the jth hour (0 <= j <= n), the penalty is calculated as follows:

For every hour when the shop is open and no customers come, the penalty increases by 1.
For every hour when the shop is closed and customers come, the penalty increases by 1.
Return the earliest hour at which the shop must be closed to incur a minimum penalty.

Note that if a shop closes at the jth hour, it means the shop is closed at the hour j.

 

Example 1:

Input: customers = "YYNY"
Output: 2
Explanation: 
- Closing the shop at the 0th hour incurs in 1+1+0+1 = 3 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 1st hour incurs in 0+1+0+1 = 2 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 2nd hour incurs in 0+0+0+1 = 1 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 3rd hour incurs in 0+0+1+1 = 2 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 4th hour incurs in 0+0+1+0 = 1 penalty.
Closing the shop at 2nd or 4th hour gives a minimum penalty. Since 2 is earlier, the optimal closing time is 2.
Example 2:

Input: customers = "NNNNN"
Output: 0
Explanation: It is best to close the shop at the 0th hour as no customers arrive.
Example 3:

Input: customers = "YYYY"
Output: 4
Explanation: It is best to close the shop at the 4th hour as customers arrive at each hour.
 

Constraints:

1 <= customers.length <= 105
customers consists only of characters 'Y' and 'N'.


Solution(#1 Two passes)-> t.c (O(n))

Algorithm
Iterate over customers, set cur_penalty and min_penalty as the total count of the character Y,
 which is the penalty if the shop closes at hour 0. Set earliest_hour as 0.

Iterate over customers, for the i th character:

If customers[i] = 'Y', decrement cur_penalty by 1. Otherwise, increment cur_penalty by 1.
If cur_penalty < min_penalty, set earliest_hour as i + 1, and set min_penalty as cur_penalty.
Return earliest_hour once the iteration is complete.

class Solution {
public:
    int bestClosingTime(string customers) {
        int n = customers.size();
        int minp, currp =0, minIndex=0;

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(customers[i] == 'Y'){
                currp++;
            }
            
        }
        minp = currp;

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(customers[i]=='Y'){
                currp--;
            }
            else{
                currp++;
            }
            
            if(minp > currp){
                minp = currp;
                minIndex = i+1;
            }
        }

        return minIndex;


        
    }
};

Solution(#1 One passe)-> t.c (O(n))

Intution:
However, we don't need the actual penalty values. 
It is important to note that the problem only requires the earliest hour with the lowest penalty. 
Thus, the only thing that matters is the penalty of the hours relative to each other, 
and our initial reference point is not significant.


For convenience, we can directly set cur_penalty to 0, which is equivalent to shifting the curve of the actual penalty vertically. 
This will not affect the calculation result. 
Note that we could initialize cur_penalty to any value and the algorithm would still work since the initial reference point is insignificant.

class Solution {
public:
    int bestClosingTime(string customers) {
        int n = customers.size();
        int minp = 0, currp = 0, minIndex=0;

        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(customers[i]=='Y'){
                currp--;
            }
            else{
                currp++;
            }
            
            if(minp > currp){
                minp = currp;
                minIndex = i+1;
            }
        }

        return minIndex;


        
    }
};
