The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.

You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.

For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.

Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 104
All integers in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
All the integers of nums1 also appear in nums2.

Solution(#1) => Using stacks and map[t.c = O(n + m), s.c = O(n+m)]

Intuition:
Montonic stack ->  A stack which maintains an order(increasing/decreasing) while elements are pushed in it.

    1.To know the next greater element of an index which must no which elements are after that element,hence to handle this we traverse the array from back (right) side.
    2.while traversing if the stack is empty (for first traversal the stack will be always empty) we store -1 in the result array [indicating no greater element present for that element] and then push that element in the queue.
    3. after the first insertion in the stack, when we go for the next element, we insure that if the stack is not empty then:
        1. if(new_element >= stack.top()) -> pop the element from the stack so that this new element can be added later(to maintain increasing order)
            -> If stack has still element left then check again unless we find a case for condition 2. or if stack is empty then NGE of new_element = -1
        2. if(new_element < stack.top()) => then NGE of new_element = stack.top().
    4. always after completing all prev processes, push that new_element in the stack. [the element should stay or not will be decided in later iterations].
