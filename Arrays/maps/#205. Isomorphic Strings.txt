Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"

Output: true

Explanation:

The strings s and t can be made identical by:

Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
Mapping 'g' to 'd'.
Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"

Output: false

Explanation:

The strings s and t can not be made identical as 'o' needs to be mapped to both 'a' and 'r'.

Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"

Output: true

 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
t.length == s.length
s and t consist of any valid ascii character.


Solution 1(Hash Map t.c =(0(n)) and s.c(0(26)->i.e,0(1)))

Approach=>
1.take two maps mp1 amd mp2;
2.in mp1 map s->t and in mp2 map t->s;
3. while maping if found that some char in s is already map previously to some char in t,
 but now it is again maping to some other char in t, return false

4. Similarly same for mp2 , if found that some char in t is already map previously to some char in s,
 but now it is again maping to some other char in s, return false

 5. 2nd map is necesarry because:
 ex: s="ab",t="cc"
 mp1=> 
 a->c(ok) , 
 b->c (ok) , 
 
 mp2=>
 c->a (ok), 
 c->b (xxx) => double mapping not possible

class Solution {
public:
    bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {
        unordered_map<char, int> m1, m2;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            char a = s[i];
            char b = t[i];

            if (m1.count(a)) {
                if (m1[a] != b) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                m1[a] = b;
            }

            if (m2.count(b)) {
                if (m2[b] != a) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                m2[b] = a;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
