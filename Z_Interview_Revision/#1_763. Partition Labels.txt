You are given a string s. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part. For example, the string "ababcc" can be partitioned into ["abab", "cc"], but partitions such as ["aba", "bcc"] or ["ab", "ab", "cc"] are invalid.

Note that the partition is done so that after concatenating all the parts in order, the resultant string should be s.

Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.
Example 2:

Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"
Output: [10]
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 500
s consists of lowercase English letters.

Solution(#1) => Map+ greedy

Intution:
1. Store last ocuurence of each character in a map;
2. Now iterate through the string from 0th charcacter => put a pointer j on its last occ
3 now iterate until you reach j, while checking if any character occur beyond j => if yes update j to tjat character's last index;
4.if j is reached store the count and increment i = j+1; => Iterate till i does not become beyond n.

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> partitionLabels(string s) {
        unordered_map<char, int> last;
        vector<int> ans;
        int n = s.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            last[s[i]] = i;
        }

        int i = 0;
        while (i < n) {
            char el = s[i];
            int lastIndex = last[s[i]];
            int j = i;
            int sum = 0;

            while (j != lastIndex) {
                if (last[s[j]] > lastIndex) {
                    lastIndex = last[s[j]];
                }
                j++;
            }
            sum = j - i + 1;
            ans.push_back(sum);
            i = j + 1;
        }

        return ans;
    }
